    <h1>Best Happy Hours in Boca Raton</h1>
    <p>Boca Raton has no shortage of places to grab a cheap drink after work. From upscale lounges to laid-back breweries, there's a happy hour for every kind of person. Here's where to go when the clock hits 4 (or 5, depending on how your day went).</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>Blue Martini</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">6000 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431</p>
      <p>Blue Martini at Town Center is the go-to spot when you want to get dressed up for happy hour. They've got over 40 signature martinis, live music most nights, and a crowd that skews stylish. The happy hour deals are genuinely good, and the energy picks up as the evening goes on. It's one of those places where you say "just one drink" and leave three hours later.</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>The Dubliner</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">435 Plaza Real, Boca Raton, FL 33432</p>
      <p>A proper Irish pub right in Mizner Park with a huge outdoor patio. The Dubliner's happy hour is straightforward: cold Guinness, good pub food, and a relaxed atmosphere. It's a great spot to meet friends after work, especially if you can snag a table outside on a nice evening. They also do live music and trivia later in the week.</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">5250 Town Center Circle, Boca Raton, FL 33486</p>
      <p>If your idea of happy hour involves margaritas and tableside guacamole, Rocco's is where you want to be. They have 400+ tequilas (yes, really), and the happy hour prices make it easy to try a few. The place gets loud and lively, especially on Fridays. Bring a group.</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>The Biergarten</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">309 Via de Palmas, Boca Raton, FL 33432</p>
      <p>German-inspired beer garden in Royal Palm Place with a big outdoor space and rotating craft taps. The Biergarten is one of the more relaxed happy hour spots in Boca. Grab a boot of beer, order some pretzels, and settle in. They do live music some nights too, and the whole vibe feels more Austin than Boca.</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>Mizner Park Grille</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">327 Plaza Real, Boca Raton, FL 33432</p>
      <p>Right on the Mizner Park promenade with great outdoor seating and solid people-watching. The happy hour here is more of a sit-down-and-enjoy-yourself kind of deal. Good wine list, nice cocktails, and the kind of atmosphere where you can actually have a conversation without yelling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>Barrel of Monks Brewing</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">1141 S Rogers Circle #5, Boca Raton, FL 33487</p>
      <p>Tucked in an industrial park off Yamato, Barrel of Monks makes Belgian-inspired beers that are genuinely world-class. The taproom is cozy, the prices are fair, and you can bring food in. It's not a typical happy hour spot, but if you like great beer in a no-frills setting, it's hard to beat.</p>
