    <h1>Things to Do Tonight in South Florida</h1>
    <p>It's the eternal question if you live in Palm Beach County: "What are we doing tonight?" South Florida has more going on than people give it credit for, especially from Boca Raton up through West Palm Beach. Here's a breakdown of what's out there, city by city.</p>

    <h2>Delray Beach</h2>
    <p>Atlantic Avenue is the main event. On any given night you can find live bands at <strong>Tin Roof</strong> and <strong>Boston's on the Beach</strong>, trivia at <strong>The Office Delray</strong>, and the kind of bar-hopping that starts casual and ends up somewhere unexpected. <strong>Johnnie Brown's</strong> is the old-school pick for pool and cheap drinks. If you want something more low-key, <strong>Saltwater Brewery</strong> out on West Atlantic has craft beer, food trucks, and a dog-friendly patio.</p>

    <h2>Boca Raton</h2>
    <p>Boca's nightlife is more spread out, but there are some great pockets. <strong>Mizner Park</strong> is the hub, with The Dubliner and Mizner Park Grille both solid choices for drinks and food. Over at Town Center, <strong>Blue Martini</strong> is the spot if you want to dress up and dance, while <strong>Rocco's Tacos</strong> is pure group-dinner-into-late-night energy. For craft beer people, <strong>Barrel of Monks</strong> and <strong>Dead Owl Brewing</strong> are both worth the trip.</p>

    <h2>West Palm Beach</h2>
    <p>Clematis Street and the surrounding blocks have the highest concentration of bars and restaurants in the county. It's walkable, it's lively, and there's usually something going on any night of the week. The Waterfront is great for outdoor drinks with a view of the Intracoastal.</p>

    <h2>Boynton Beach & Lake Worth Beach</h2>
    <p>These two towns punch above their weight. Lake Worth's downtown has a funky, artsy vibe with dive bars and live music. Boynton Beach has been growing its scene too, with new spots opening up along Federal Highway and near the marina.</p>
