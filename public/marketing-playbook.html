<p class="subtitle">Launch weekend strategy: Reddit, Facebook, and SEO. Created Feb 21, 2026.</p>

<!-- ==================== REDDIT ==================== -->
<h2>📱 Reddit Posts</h2>
<p>Post from u/BackfireBand or a new dedicated account. Space posts 30-60 min apart to avoid spam flags. Best times: Thursday-Saturday afternoon/evening.</p>

<div class="tip">Pro tip: Don't just drop links. Be genuinely helpful. Answer questions in the comments. Reddit will destroy you if you look like you're just promoting.</div>

  <div class="title-line">What's actually happening in Delray this weekend?</div>
  <div class="body-text">I got tired of scrolling through Instagram stories and random event pages trying to figure out what's going on in Delray on any given night. So I started putting together a free site that pulls all the events, happy hours, live music, trivia nights, etc. into one place.

It covers day stuff too - yoga, beach activities, farmers markets, brunch spots.

Check it out: theactiveowl.com

It's still early but I've got Delray Beach, Boca, Boynton, Lake Worth, and West Palm loaded up. If I'm missing your favorite spot, let me know and I'll add it.

Not trying to sell anything. Just wanted something like this to exist.</div>

  <div class="body-text">Built a site that shows what's happening in Boca Raton every day. Live music, trivia, happy hours, comedy, DJs - plus daytime stuff like yoga, markets, and beach activities.

You can switch between day mode and night mode depending on what you're looking for. It also shows you what's happening right now, what's starting soon, and what's free.

theactiveowl.com - just switch the city to Boca Raton.

It's free, no ads, no sign-up. I'm adding new venues every week. If you know a spot that should be on there, drop it in the comments.</div>

Daytime: yoga, beach sports, farmers markets, hiking, brunch, parks
Nighttime: bars, live music, DJs, trivia, karaoke, happy hours, comedy

Right now it covers Delray Beach, Boca Raton, Boynton Beach, Lake Worth Beach, and West Palm Beach. Expanding to more cities soon.

It's called The Active Owl: theactiveowl.com

Has a map view, categories, filters for free events, and you can save your favorites. No app to download, works in your browser.

You can filter by what's happening right now, what's free, what's under $20, and browse by category. There's a map view too.

theactiveowl.com - switch to West Palm Beach in the city picker.

It's free and I update the venues regularly. If your favorite WPB spot isn't listed, tell me about it and I'll get it added.</div>

  <div class="title-line">Built a local events finder for South Florida - vanilla JS, no frameworks</div>
  <div class="body-text">I built The Active Owl (theactiveowl.com) as a day/night activity finder for South Florida cities.

Tech stack: Pure Node.js backend, vanilla JavaScript frontend, no npm dependencies, JSON flat-file storage. Hosted on Vercel.

Features:
- Day/night mode with completely different themes and event categories
- Interactive map with Leaflet + OpenStreetMap
- Smart filters: happening now, starting soon, free events
- 10-day venue schedules
- Mobile-first, works offline after first load

Covering 5 cities so far with about 50 venues. The data is all manually curated which is a grind but keeps quality high.

Would love feedback on the UX. What would make you come back to a site like this?</div>
