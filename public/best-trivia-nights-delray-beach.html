    <h1>Best Trivia Nights in Delray Beach</h1>
    <p>Delray Beach has a surprisingly good trivia scene. Whether you're a regular who shows up with a locked-in team every week, or you just want to grab a beer and test your knowledge on a random Tuesday, there are solid options all over town. Here are the spots worth checking out.</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>The Office Delray</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">201 E Atlantic Ave, Delray Beach, FL 33444</p>
      <p>The Office is one of the most popular trivia spots on Atlantic Ave, and for good reason. It's a sleek gastropub with great food, strong drinks, and a trivia night that fills up fast. The crowd is a mix of after-work regulars and competitive teams who take it pretty seriously. Get there early if you want a good table.</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>Park Tavern</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">32 SE 2nd Ave, Delray Beach, FL 33444</p>
      <p>Park Tavern is a neighborhood bar with pool tables, craft cocktails, and weekly trivia that draws a loyal crowd. It's more laid-back than some of the Atlantic Ave spots, which makes it perfect if you want to play without the intensity. Good beer list too.</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>Tim Finnegans Irish Pub</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">2885 S Federal Hwy, Delray Beach, FL 33483</p>
      <p>If you like your trivia with a Guinness and some Celtic music in the background, Tim Finnegans is your place. It's a proper Irish pub with dark wood, a great tap list, and trivia nights that feel like you're playing in Dublin (minus the weather). A little off the main drag on Federal Highway, which means it's easier to grab a spot.</p>

    <div class="venue-card">
      <h2>Saltwater Brewery</h2>
      <p class="venue-addr">1701 W Atlantic Ave, Delray Beach, FL 33444</p>
      <p>Saltwater is a laid-back craft brewery with a big outdoor space, food trucks, and a chill vibe. Their trivia nights are casual and fun, and you can bring your dog. The beer is solid (try the Screamin' Reels IPA), and the whole atmosphere is just easy. No pretension, no dress code, just good questions and cold beer.</p>

    <p>Most of these spots run trivia weekly, but days and times can shift. Your best bet is to check <a href="https://theactiveowl.com/#/delray-beach">The Active Owl's Delray Beach page</a> for the current schedule so you're not showing up on the wrong night.</p>
